    "Functions are advantageous to have in your programs for several reasons:\n",
    "Reusability: Functions allow you to define a block of code that can be reused multiple times within your program. This saves you from writing the same code again and again, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Functions promote modularity by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. Each function can be designed to perform a specific task, making your code easier to read, understand, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions provide a level of abstraction by hiding the implementation details of a particular task. You can use a function without needing to know how it is implemented, as long as you understand its inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organization: Functions help in organizing your code logically. You can group related code together in functions, making it easier to navigate and maintain your program."
